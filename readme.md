\*\*\* Blog - The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

TypeScript offers union and intersection types to developers to reduce excessive writing of types.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Union Type: </strong>A union type describes a value that can be one of several types.
<br>
<code>
type FrontendDeveloper = 'SeniorDeveloper'|'JuniorDeveloper';
<br>
const Fresher : FrontendDeveloper = 'JuniorDeveloper'
</code>
<br>
In the above example, we cannot assign any other value in the Fresher variable except 'Senior Developer' or 'Junior Developer'. It helps us not to assign any irrelevant value to a specific variable.

<br>
<strong>Intersection Type</strong>
<br>
<code>
type User = {
name: string;
}

type Admin = {
role: string;
}

let userAdmin: User & Admin = {
name: 'John Doe',
role: 'admin'
};
</code>
<br>
In this case, userAdmin has both the properties of User and Admin. This is useful when you want to create an object that needs multiple types for a single variable type.

<br> 
So, we can tell that union type and intersection type are very useful to developers to create error-proof applications.
